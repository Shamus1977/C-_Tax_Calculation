# C-_Tax_Calculation
Tax calculation for employees based in data from csv files.

This is the final project for my C# .Net ADN102 course at Woz-U.
Instructions are in comments in the program.cs file, just above the main method.
CSV files are in the bin.
There is also a zip file of this project.
Thank you for looking at my project!
